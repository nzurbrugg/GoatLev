The goal of this project is to develop a durable stand for milking goats while keeping material costs to a minimum.  It should be able to be produced with common garage tools and commonly available materials.

### How do I view the latest design?
Two methods are available:
* Quick Method: Click on the .stl file above to view the rough 3D model.

* Accurate Method: Click "Download .zip" (on the right side).  Included in the zip file is a .fcstd file.  To open the file you will need FreeCAD, and then from there you can take measurements.  FreeCAD is a free and open source CAD program that works on Windows, Mac, or Linux.  If you don't have FreeCAD installed, please visit www.freecadweb.org.

### Note on units in the .fcstd file
Currently the model shows dimensions in mm, but actually they should be relabeled as inches.  FreeCAD has some capability to handle inches, but it is not fully implemented, so for now everything is labeled mm.
